Why do they always say '404' when the page isn't found? That code number is an implementation detail of the transfer protocol. It doesn't need to be numbered 404; the next transfer protocol could use any number they want for the same purpose. Certainly the user doesn't need to know that the status code is 404, he only needs to know that the page wasn't found. Not only that, but you have to explain to most users that 404 means the page wasn't found. Wouldn't it be simpler if we just said, 'Page not found!' instead of '404' in the first place?
